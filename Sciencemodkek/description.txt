From the creator of Science Mod (Doesn't mean I'm proud just means you can expect the quality)
A feature from Sciencemod I will be expanding is changing the classes for weapons, For example the starfury is only a sword, Why not add a bow variant, or a spell variant, making every item useful throughout playthroughs

V0.1 The Callbacks Update
Added Blunderbuss
Added Star Fury Weapon Variants
